<b>Abstract---</b>With the rise of the usage and interest on social media platforms, *emojis* have become an increasingly important part of the written language and one of the most important signals for micro-blog sentiment analysis. In this paper, we employed and evaluated classification models using two different representations based on bag-of-words and fastText to address the problem of sentiment analysis over emojis/emoticons for Turkish positive, negative and neutral tweets. At first, the bag-of-words approach is used as a simple and efficient baseline method for tweet representation, where the classifiers such as *Na√Øve Bayes*, *Logistic Regression*, *Support Vector Machines*, *Decision Trees* have been applied to these tweets. Secondly, we utilized *fastText* to represent tweets as word n-grams for sentiment analysis problem. The results show that there is no significant difference between the two models. While fastText shows 79% and the Logistic Regression classifier obtains 77% F1-score for binary classification, fastText performs 62% and Logistic Regression has 58% F1-score for multi-class classification. This study is considered as the first study that contributes to the literature by applying different vector representations such as bag-of-words and fastText to predict Turkish tweets over emojis. This study can also be utilized to predict emojis on social media context in the future.
