<b>Abstract---</b>Machine learning and artificial intelligence play an ever more crucial role in mitigating important 
societal problems, such as the prevalence of hate speech. We describe the Hateful Memes Challenge competition, held at 
NeurIPS 2020, focusing on multimodal hate speech. The aim of the challenge is to facilitate further research into 
multimodal reasoning and understanding.
