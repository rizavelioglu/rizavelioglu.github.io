<b>Abstract---</b>Accurate traffic prediction is a key ingredient to enable traffic management like rerouting cars to 
reduce road congestion or regulating traffic via dynamic speed limits to maintain a steady flow. One way to represent 
traffic data is as temporally changing heatmaps visualizing attributes of traffic, such as speed and volume. In recent 
approaches, UNet models have shown state of the art performance on traffic forecasting from such heatmaps. We propose to
combine the U-Net architecture with graph layers which improves spatial generalization to unseen road networks compared 
to a Vanilla U-Net. In particular, we specialize existing graph operations to be sensitive to geographical topology and 
generalize pooling and upsampling operations to be applicable to graphs.
