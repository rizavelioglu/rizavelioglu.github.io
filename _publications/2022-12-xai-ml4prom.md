<b>Abstract---</b>
In modern business processes, the amount of data collected has increased substantially in recent years. 
Because this data can potentially yield valuable insights, automated knowledge extraction based on process 
mining has been proposed, among other techniques, to provide users with intuitive access to the information 
contained therein. At present, the majority of technologies aim to reconstruct explicit business process models. 
These are directly interpretable but limited concerning the integration of diverse and real-valued information 
sources. On the other hand, Machine Learning (ML) benefits from the vast amount of data available and can deal 
with high-dimensional sources, yet it has rarely been applied to being used in processes. In this contribution, 
we evaluate the capability of modern Transformer architectures as well as more classical ML technologies of 
modeling process regularities, as can be quantitatively evaluated by their prediction capability. In addition, 
we demonstrate the capability of attentional properties and feature relevance determination by highlighting 
features that are crucial to the processes' predictive abilities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach 
using five benchmark datasets and show that the ML models are capable of predicting critical outcomes and that 
the attention mechanisms or XAI components offer new insights into the underlying processes.
